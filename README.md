# car-data-visualisation-analysis
This project analyzes data from the Cars93.csv dataset to explore various characteristics of car models by different manufacturers. Using data visualization techniques in Python, we answer key questions about car performance, fuel efficiency, and relationships between different attributes.

Project Overview The project explores the following key questions through data visualizations:

Revs Per Mile by Manufacturer: A box plot comparing the revs per mile for Audi, Hyundai, Suzuki, and Toyota models. The analysis determines which manufacturer has cars with the highest revs per mile.
Fuel Efficiency Comparison: A histogram comparing miles per gallon (MPG) in the city and on the highway to understand fuel efficiency trends.
Relationship Between Wheelbase and Turning Circle: A line plot to examine how the wheelbase size correlates with the turning circle, providing insights into handling characteristics.
Horsepower by Car Type: A bar plot showing the mean horsepower for different car types (e.g., Small, Midsize), which helps determine if larger car types generally have more horsepower.
Technologies Used:

Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Data The dataset Cars93.csv includes various attributes of car models from 1993, such as manufacturer, MPG, horsepower, revs per mile, wheelbase, turning circle, and car type. It provides a diverse set of variables suitable for an in-depth exploratory analysis.

Instructions to Run the Notebook

Clone this repository.
Open data_viz_task.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
Ensure that the Cars93.csv file is in the same directory as the notebook.
Run each cell sequentially to generate the visualizations.
Results and Interpretation

Box Plot of Revs Per Mile: The box plot reveals which manufacturerâ€™s cars have higher revs per mile, indicating potential differences in engine performance and gearing.
City vs. Highway MPG: The dual histogram shows if cars generally achieve better fuel efficiency on the highway than in the city.
Wheelbase vs. Turning Circle: This plot illustrates the relationship between wheelbase size and turning circle, highlighting handling characteristics as the wheelbase changes.
Horsepower by Car Type: The bar plot allows us to see if larger car types typically have higher horsepower, which is useful for consumers choosing cars based on size and power.
Conclusion This project provides insights into various aspects of car performance and efficiency. Through visualizations, we gain a better understanding of how different manufacturers, car types, and car characteristics compare.
